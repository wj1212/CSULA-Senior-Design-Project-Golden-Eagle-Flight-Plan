# CSULA Senior Design Project

## ✨ Objective
The project aims to support student success by providing a comprehensive platform that addresses three key areas: **Academic Preparation**, **Career Development**, and **Leadership & Community Engagement**. Our goal is to create a dynamic, evidence-based system that guides students through their academic journey and prepares them for life after graduation.

* **Expose Advanced Opportunities 🚀**: Actively connect students to advanced opportunities, including research projects, internships, and competitions that align with their interests.
* **Career-Readiness Plan 💼**: Provide tailored recommendations for career skills and professional experiences based on the student's academic progress and goals.
* **Time Management ⏳**: Assist students in developing balanced schedules that incorporate study, rest, and recreation for overall well-being.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Student Profile Intake 📝**: A user-friendly interface for students to input their completed courses, career interests, and personal constraints (e.g., work hours, ADA requirements).
* **Opportunity Finder 🔍**: An intelligent system that recommends relevant research projects, internships, student clubs, and leadership activities based on the student's profile.
* **Plan Tracker 📈**: A dashboard that provides customized recommendations in three main areas: Academic Preparation, Career Development, and Leadership/Community Engagement.
* **Career ↔ Course Outcome Matching 🔗**: A feature that matches course learning outcomes and activities to specific job skills and career pathways.
* **University Rules Engine 🏛️**: A backend system that encodes key university policies (e.g., withdrawal, graduation requirements, financial aid limits) to provide proactive guidance and prevent students from getting off track.
* **Faculty/Advisor Opportunity Input 🧑‍🏫**: A simple interface for faculty and advisors to submit new opportunities for students, including a title, description, expiration date, and learning outcomes.
* **Student Support Services Integration ❤️**: Integration with various campus resources like tutoring centers, advising centers, and food pantries, linking them to a student's specific needs and major.
* **Advisor Dashboard 📊**: A dedicated view for advisors to monitor student profiles, track their progress, and provide comments or make adjustments to their plans.

## 💡 Other Considerations

* **Data Privacy 🔒**: Protecting student data is a top priority, and all platform features must comply with FERPA standards.
* **Explainability 🧐**: All AI-powered recommendations must be transparent, citing the specific rules, policies, or source documents used to generate the suggestion.
* **Scalability 🌐**: The platform should be designed to support multiple majors and departments across the entire campus.
